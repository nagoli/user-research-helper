    Do you prefer making your coffee at home or buying it outside? Why?

Speaker B [13184.00 - 24168.00]:
    I usually make my first cup at home because it's part of my morning routine. But I often grab a latte on my way to the office or during lunch because it's convenient and feels like a little treat.

Speaker A [24304.00 - 31966.00]:
    What are the most important factors for you when choosing coffee? E. G. Taste, price, origin, etc.

Speaker B [32078.00 - 41390.00]:
    The taste and quality are paramount. I also like to support local roasters when possible. Price is less of a concern for me as long as the coffee is good.

    Do you think drinking coffee impacts your energy or productivity? If so, how?

    Absolutely. As an executive, my schedule is hectic and coffee keeps me sharp. It's part ritual, part necessity. It helps me stay focused during long meetings.

    Early in my career, I landed a major client deal after a casual coffee meeting. I'll never forget how that simple invitation to grab a coffee turned into a pivotal business relationship.
