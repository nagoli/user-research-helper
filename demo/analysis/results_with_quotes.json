    "question_text": "Do you prefer making your coffee at home or buying it outside? Why?",

([male], [rural])\nI make my first cup at home to save money, and then I buy one at the factory's vending machine or the nearby cafe because it's convenient. ([male], [urban])\nI enjoy the ritual of brewing a pot in my kitchen. ([female], [rural])\nI buy coffee outside most of the time because I'm always on the go.
